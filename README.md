AirRocks-FlightController
=========================

ARFC is a quad-copter flight controller which uses machine learning to fly better, faster, and smarter.

Progress 
-------------------
__Subsystems__  
_Defined as hardware and the basic software needed to use it._
  1. PID - 1%    
2. Started (IMUStabilizer)   
  2. SPI - 99%     
3. All interfaces complete   
4. Waiting for "failsafe landing procedure"     
  3. SCA - 50%    
4. Waiting on larger battery  
5. Needs bettery wiring / not enough physical space in SCA module space  
  4. DHCP interface - 0%    
5. Waiting on aditional Rpi to test P2P posibilities  

__Protocol__  
_Defined as a design feature that achieves its goal._  
  1. Proportional integral derivative controller __(PID)__ - 1%  
2. Requires research  
  2. SPI - 100%    
3. Works great, coms are fast and reliable.   
  3. Spatial contextual awareness (SCA) - 0%  
4. Must wait for PID Subsystem  
  5. User interface & (DHCP)
6. Waiting for Android developement to start.
